    "After trials and errors we decided to use the UNet architecture. It is a widely used CNN for image segmentation tasks, because it can capture both the overall structure and fine details of objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "We resized all images and masks to 256x256 to reduce memory usage and speed up training, even though using the full 768x768 resolution would likely produce more accurate segmentations. Similarly, we limited the dataset to a balanced sample of 10,000 images to save computational resources while maintaining a representative set of images with and without ships. Hyperparameters were chosen after testing multiple configurations to optimize segmentation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model outputs a single-channel probability map for each image, indicating the likelihood that each pixel belongs to a ship. To train the model, we use a combined loss function that equally weights Binary Crossentropy and Dice loss. Binary Crossentropy encourages correct pixel-wise predictions, while Dice loss directly measures the overlap between the predicted and true masks, which is particularly useful for handling the class imbalance between ship and background pixels. We also monitor Intersection over Union (IoU) and F2 score as metrics, which provide a more holistic evaluation of segmentation quality by considering both precision and recall, rather than just pixel-wise accuracy.\n",

That wouldn’t tell us anything about how well it actually detects ships. For this reason, we use Intersection over Union (IoU) and F2 score, which focus on how good the predicted masks are.\n",

    "\n",
    "It basically counts how many pixels the prediction got right compared to the total pixels that should have been or were predicted as ships. A perfect mask gets 1, and no overlap gets 0. This helps us focus on actual ship pixels rather than the huge number of background pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**F2 Score:**\n",
    "The F-beta score combines precision and recall. We use F2, which weights recall more heavily because missing ship pixels is worse than predicting a few extra:\n",

    "Once the UNet model is trained, we evaluate it on the held-out test set to see how well it generalizes. Since most images are mostly background, simple accuracy would be misleading, so we focus on metrics like IoU and F2 score, which better reflect how well the model detects ships and captures their shapes. The combined loss gives an overall sense of both pixel-level accuracy and mask overlap quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For inference, we take each image, resize it to 256x256 for the model, and predict a pixel-wise probability map. This map is then resized back to the original 768x768 resolution and thresholded to produce a binary mask highlighting the ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how well the model performs, we visualize both curated examples and random test images. Curated picks illustrate strengths such as detecting low-contrast ships, handling multiple vessels, and correctly ignoring empty images, while also showing where minor noise or segmentation errors occur. Random samples give a broader view of performance across the dataset, helping us see both successes and typical failure modes in realistic scenarios."
